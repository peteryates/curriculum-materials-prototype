<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Subject knowledge</h2>
<p>A dome volcano is a round shaped mountain made of viscous lava. The lava has a high silica content that prevents the lava from flowing very far from its vent.</p>
<p>Lava domes often form in calderas of stratovolcanoes after a major eruption where the summit of the volcano collapses or is blown away during the eruption. A lava dome has been forming in the crater of Mount Saint Helens after the 1980 eruption of the volcano.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-keading-s">Domes on slopes composite volcanoes</h4>
<p>Other small domes form on the side of large composite volcanoes. A lava dome on the slopes of a composite volcano can become unstable when hot lava erupts causing pyroclastic flows to form on its slopes. These deadly pyroclastic flows sweep down the sides of volcanoes killing everything in their path.</p>
<p>The Mount Pinatubo eruption on June 15, 1991 eruption was the second largest of the 20th century and the largest near a densely populated area during the century. It coincided with a massive storm which spread the ash over a wide area. It was so big it also lowered temperatures worldwide for the next 2 years.</p>
